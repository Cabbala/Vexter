# Vexter

Vexter is the Mac-side control plane for comparative analysis of `Cabbala/Dexter` and `Cabbala/Mew-X`. Git lives here; runtime, databases, logs, and replay data live on Windows via `ssh win-lan`.

## Fixed Environment Split

- Mac control plane: `/Users/cabbala/Projects/Vexter`
- Windows runtime host: `win-lan`
- Windows preferred root: `D:\Quant\Vexter`, with fallback to user space
- VPS: later-stage validation only

## Bootstrap Workflow

1. Run `./scripts/sync_reference_repos.sh` to clone or refresh the source repos into the local ignored `sources/` workspace.
2. Run `./scripts/bootstrap_windows_workspace.sh` from the Mac control plane to discover and prepare the Windows runtime/data layout.
3. Run `./scripts/build_proof_bundle.sh` to refresh the task proof artifact bundle.
4. Run `pytest -q` before Git operations.
5. Complete Git operations from the Mac control plane so GitHub remains the source of truth.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/`, `specs/`, `ops/`, `plans/`: fixed guidance imported from the bootstrap bundle
- `manifests/`: committed source repo and environment manifests
- `scripts/`: Mac-side bootstrap and proof automation
- `artifacts/`: context pack, summary, proof manifest, task ledger, and bundles
- `tests/`: bootstrap validation checks

## Current Task

`TASK-001-source-assessment` is complete on `main`. The shared evaluation contract, source assessments, instrumentation plans, and Windows runtime layout are now the source of truth for Vexter.

`TASK-002-dexter-instrumentation` is complete on `main` as of 2026-03-21. The paired Dexter source branch adds observational NDJSON events, masked config export, leaderboard snapshots, and stagnant-mint replay exports without changing strategy logic.

`TASK-003-mewx-instrumentation` is complete on `main` after merging PR #3 on 2026-03-21. The paired Mew-X source branch adds observational NDJSON events, masked config export, candidate refresh snapshots, and session summaries without changing strategy or execution decisions.

`TASK-004-comparison-analysis` adds the first Vexter-side validator, shared metrics derivation layer, side-by-side comparison pack builder, and Windows collection runbook while keeping Dexter and Mew-X instrumentation frozen.

`TASK-005-live-comparison-evidence` started from `main` on 2026-03-21, but the first live matched-window collection attempt is blocked. The fixed Windows root exists on `DESKTOP-NNC6MPS`, yet `data/raw/{dexter,mewx}`, runtime `config` / `export`, and `artifacts/unified/comparison_inputs` were empty, and the host does not currently expose the Mew-X runtime prerequisites (`cargo`, `rustc`, `psql`, or a PostgreSQL listener on `127.0.0.1:5432`). No live comparison pack was produced, no winners or ties were recorded, and `TASK-006` cannot begin.
