# ATTESTATION-REFRESH Details

## Verified Starting Point
- Latest Vexter `main`: PR `#84` merge commit `31fbee24beb56eb55338d4529c2c9420a0ac5ea9` on `2026-03-27T14:23:43Z`
- Dexter pinned commit: `ddeb18c0dd21fa3a15d4a6a85573428f7d7ae938`
- Frozen Mew-X commit: `dba3dc84f1e2d4efc90fa5a4561593edcc9dd37a`
- Accepted baseline: `supervised_run_retry_gate_attestation_record_pack_regeneration_blocked`

## Deliverable
Promote one bounded attestation refresh lane that keeps current status, report, summary, proof, handoff, checklist, and decision-surface pointers coherent while fail-closing retry-gate review until every required face has a current, fresh-enough, reviewable regenerated locator and the current record-pack regeneration can be rerun honestly.
